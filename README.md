# CNC-Shield-UnoMZ

A DSPCB (Double-Sided Printed Circuit Board) design for a CNC Shield compatible with Arduino Uno.

## About

This is a design from DSPCB - a double-sided printed circuit board CNC Shield that extends the capabilities of the Arduino Uno for CNC (Computer Numerical Control) applications.

## Features

- **Double-Sided PCB Design**: Uses DSPCB technology for improved reliability and compactness
- **Arduino Uno Compatible**: Designed as a shield that fits directly onto Arduino Uno R3
- **Multi-Axis Control**: Supports stepper motor drivers for X, Y, Z, and optionally A axis control
- **GRBL Compatible**: Works with GRBL firmware for G-code interpretation and execution
- **Modular Design**: Accepts standard stepper motor drivers (A4988, DRV8825, etc.)

## What is DSPCB?

DSPCB stands for Double-Sided Printed Circuit Board. This design approach uses both sides of the PCB for routing traces, which allows for:
- More compact board layouts
- Better signal separation between power and logic
- Improved reliability
- Enhanced electromagnetic compatibility

## Applications

This CNC Shield can be used for various CNC applications including:
- CNC mills and routers
- Laser cutters
- 3D printers
- Plotters
- Any project requiring precise multi-axis stepper motor control
